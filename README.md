## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- CMake (Version 3.10 or higher)

To install the required packages on Ubuntu, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
```

## Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build the project using the terminal:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyCProject.git
    cd MyCProject
    ```

2. **Create a build directory**:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Generate build files using CMake**:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Compile the project**:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Run the Project

After building the project, run the executable from the `build` directory:

```bash
./MyCProject
```

You should see the output:

```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean up all generated files and start fresh, delete the `build` directory:

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf build
```

### Instructions for Creating the `README.md` File

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (`MyCProject`).

2. Create a new `README.md` file using a text editor like `nano`:

   ```bash
   nano README.md
   ```

3. Copy the content provided above into the file.

4. Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y` and `Enter`).

### Summary

Your project now includes a `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to build and run the C project using only the terminal. This should help anyone who wants to work with or build your project. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!
